# E-Commerce Back End


• build back end for e-commerce site.
• configure a working Express.js API to use Sequelize to interact with a MySQL database.
• provide walkthrough vid
• using functional Express.js API, WHEN adding my database name, MySQL username, and MySQL password to an environment (env file?) variable file, ble to connect to a database using Sequelize.
• Entering schema and seed commands and a development database is created and is seeded with test data
• WHEN I enter the command npm run start to invoke the application, server is started and the Sequelize models are synced to the MySQL database
• WHEN I open API GET routes in Insomnia for categories, products, or tags the data for each of these routes is displayed in a formatted JSON
• WHEN I test API POST, PUT, and DELETE routes in Insomnia, able to successfully create, update, and delete data in my database
• SEE VID for demo

• You’ll need to use the [MySQL2](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mysql2) and [Sequelize](https://www.npmjs.com/package/sequelize) packages to connect your Express.js API to a MySQL database and the [dotenv](https://www.npmjs.com/package/dotenv) package to use environment variables to store sensitive data.

• Use the `schema.sql` file in the `db` folder to create your database with MySQL shell commands. Use environment variables to store sensitive data like your MySQL username, password, and database name.

### Database Models

Your database should contain the following four models, including the requirements listed for each model:

* `Category`

  * `id`

    * Integer.
  
    * Doesn't allow null values.
  
    * Set as primary key.
  
    * Uses auto increment.

  * `category_name`
  
    * String.
  
    * Doesn't allow null values.

* `Product`

  * `id`
  
    * Integer.
  
    * Doesn't allow null values.
  
    * Set as primary key.
  
    * Uses auto increment.

  * `product_name`
  
    * String.
  
    * Doesn't allow null values.

  * `price`
  
    * Decimal.
  
    * Doesn't allow null values.
  
    * Validates that the value is a decimal.

  * `stock`
  
    * Integer.
  
    * Doesn't allow null values.
  
    * Set a default value of `10`.
  
    * Validates that the value is numeric.

  * `category_id`
  
    * Integer.
  
    * References the `Category` model's `id`.

* `Tag`

  * `id`
  
    * Integer.
  
    * Doesn't allow null values.
  
    * Set as primary key.
  
    * Uses auto increment.

  * `tag_name`
  
    * String.

* `ProductTag`

  * `id`

    * Integer.

    * Doesn't allow null values.

    * Set as primary key.

    * Uses auto increment.

  * `product_id`

    * Integer.

    * References the `Product` model's `id`.

  * `tag_id`

    * Integer.

    * References the `Tag` model's `id`.

### Associations

You'll need to execute association methods on your Sequelize models to create the following relationships between them:

* `Product` belongs to `Category`, and `Category` has many `Product` models, as a category can have multiple products but a product can only belong to one category.

* `Product` belongs to many `Tag` models, and `Tag` belongs to many `Product` models. Allow products to have multiple tags and tags to have many products by using the `ProductTag` through model.

> **Hint:** Make sure you set up foreign key relationships that match the column we created in the respective models.

### Fill Out the API Routes to Perform RESTful CRUD Operations

Fill out the unfinished routes in `product-routes.js`, `tag-routes.js`, and `category-routes.js` to perform create, read, update, and delete operations using your Sequelize models.

Note that the functionality for creating the many-to-many relationship for products has already been completed for you.

> **Hint**: Be sure to look at the mini-project code for syntax help and use your model's column definitions to figure out what `req.body` will be for POST and PUT routes!

### Seed the Database

After creating the models and routes, run `npm run seed` to seed data to your database so that you can test your routes.

### Sync Sequelize to the Database on Server Start

Create the code needed in `server.js` to sync the Sequelize models to the MySQL database on server start.

* The GitHub repository containing your application code.
* Vid requirements:
1) demonstrates the functionality of the e-commerce back end must be submitted, and a link to the video should be included in your readme file.
2) show all of the technical acceptance criteria being met.
3) demonstrate how to create the schema from the MySQL shell.
4) Demonstrate how to seed the database from the command line.
5) demonstrate how to start the application’s server.
6) demonstrate GET routes for all categories, all products, and all tags being tested in Insomnia.
7) demonstrate GET routes for a single category, a single product, and a single tag being tested in Insomnia.
8) demonstrate POST, PUT, and DELETE routes for categories, products, and tags being tested in Insomnia.

SUBMIT 1) A walkthrough video demonstrating the functionality of the application and all of the acceptance criteria being met.
       2) The URL of the GitHub repository. Give the repository a unique name and include a readme describing the project.
